# Zero-Knowledge Proofs Formal Model

## 1. Mathematical Foundations

### 1.1 Definitions

**Definition 1.1.1** (Zero-Knowledge Proof System) A zero-knowledge proof system for a language $L$ is a tuple $(P, V)$ of probabilistic polynomial-time interactive algorithms with the following properties:

1. **Completeness**: For every $x \in L$, if $P$ and $V$ follow the protocol on input $x$, then $V$ accepts with probability at least $1-\varepsilon(|x|)$, where $\varepsilon$ is a negligible function.

2. **Soundness**: For every $x \notin L$ and every prover strategy $P^*$, if $P^*$ and $V$ interact on input $x$, then $V$ accepts with probability at most $\delta(|x|)$, where $\delta$ is a negligible function.

3. **Zero-Knowledge**: For every probabilistic polynomial-time verifier strategy $V^*$, there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time simulator $S$ such that for every $x \in L$, the distribution of the transcripts of interactions between $P$ and $V^*$ on input $x$ is computationally indistinguishable from the output distribution of $S$ on input $x$.

**Definition 1.1.2** (Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof) A non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) system for language $L$ is a triple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms $(G, P, V)$ such that:

1. $G$ is a probabilistic algorithm that generates a common reference string $\sigma$.
2. $P$ takes as input the common reference string $\sigma$, a statement $x \in L$, and a witness $w$, and outputs a proof $\pi$.
3. $V$ takes as input the common reference string $\sigma$, a statement $x$, and a proof $\pi$, and outputs a bit $b \in \{0, 1\}$.

The system satisfies completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge properties analogous to the interactive case.

### 1.2 Commitment Schemes

**Definition 1.2.1** (Commitment Scheme) A commitment scheme is a pair of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms $(C, V)$ such that:

1. $C$ takes a message $m$ and randomness $r$ and outputs a commitment $c = C(m, r)$.
2. $V$ takes a commitment $c$, a message $m$, and randomness $r$, and outputs a bit $b = V(c, m, r)$ indicating whether the commitment is valid.

The scheme must satisfy:

1. **Binding**: It is computationally infeasible to find $m_1 \neq m_2$ and $r_1, r_2$ such that $C(m_1, r_1) = C(m_2, r_2)$.
2. **Hiding**: For any $m_1, m_2$, the distributions of $C(m_1, r)$ and $C(m_2, r)$ for randomly chosen $r$ are computationally indistinguishable.

## 2. zk-SNARK Formal Model

### 2.1 Definitions

**Definition 2.1.1** (zk-SNARK) A zk-SNARK for an NP relation $R$ is a tuple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms $(G, P, V)$ such that:

1. $G(1^\lambda, R) \rightarrow (pk, vk)$: The key generation algorithm takes a security parameter $\lambda$ and relation $R$, and outputs a proving key $pk$ and a verification key $vk$.
2. $P(pk, x, w) \rightarrow \pi$: The proving algorithm takes the proving key $pk$, a statement $x$, and a witness $w$ such that $(x, w) \in R$, and outputs a proof $\pi$.
3. $V(vk, x, \pi) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$: The verification algorithm takes the verification key $vk$, a statement $x$, and a proof $\pi$, and outputs a bit indicating acceptance or rejection.

A zk-SNARK must satisfy:

1. **Completeness**: For all $(x, w) \in R$, if $(pk, vk) \leftarrow G(1^\lambda, R)$ and $\pi \leftarrow P(pk, x, w)$, then $V(vk, x, \pi) = 1$ with probability 1.

2. **Knowledge Soundness**: For any probabilistic polynomial-time prover $P^*$, there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time extractor $E$ such that for all statements $x$:
   $$\Pr[V(vk, x, \pi) = 1 \land (x, w) \notin R] \leq \text{negl}(\lambda)$$
   where $\pi$ is generated by $P^*$ and $w$ is extracted by $E$.

3. **Zero-Knowledge**: There exists a probabilistic polynomial-time simulator $S$ such that for all $(x, w) \in R$:
   $$\{(pk, vk, P(pk, x, w))\} \approx_c \{S(vk, x)\}$$
   where $\approx_c$ denotes computational indistinguishability.

### 2.2 Polynomial Commitment Schemes

**Definition 2.2.1** (Polynomial Commitment) A polynomial commitment scheme is a tuple of algorithms $(Setup, Commit, Open, Verify)$ such that:

1. $Setup(1^\lambda, d) \rightarrow pp$: Generates public parameters $pp$ for polynomials of degree at most $d$.
2. $Commit(pp, f) \rightarrow (c, d)$: Commits to a polynomial $f$ and outputs a commitment $c$ and decommitment information $d$.
3. $Open(pp, c, i, y, d) \rightarrow \pi$: Generates a proof $\pi$ that $f(i) = y$.
4. $Verify(pp, c, i, y, \pi) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$: Verifies that $f(i) = y$ given the commitment $c$ and proof $\pi$.

## 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Web3

### 3.1 Formal Model for Privacy-Preserving Transactions

**Definition 3.1.1** (Privacy-Preserving Transaction) A privacy-preserving transaction system is a tuple $(Setup, CreateAccount, CreateTx, VerifyTx)$ such that:

1. $Setup(1^\lambda) \rightarrow pp$: Generates public parameters $pp$.
2. $CreateAccount(pp) \rightarrow (pk, sk)$: Creates a public key $pk$ and secret key $sk$.
3. $CreateTx(pp, sk, inputs, outputs) \rightarrow tx$: Creates a transaction $tx$ that spends inputs and creates outputs.
4. $VerifyTx(pp, tx) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$: Verifies that a transaction $tx$ is valid.

**Theorem 3.1.2** (Transaction Privacy) Under the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, the privacy-preserving transaction system satisfies the following properties:

1. **Balance**: The sum of input values equals the sum of output values.
2. **Ownership**: Only the owner of an input can spend it.
3. **Privacy**: The values and ownership of inputs and outputs are hidden from public view.

*Proof sketch:* The balance property is enforced through a zero-knowledge proof that the sum of inputs equals the sum of outputs. Ownership is enforced through digital signatures. Privacy is achieved through the hiding property of commitment schemes and the zero-knowledge property of the proof system.

### 3.2 Formal Model for Smart Contract Privacy

**Definition 3.2.1** (Private Smart Contract) A private smart contract system is a tuple $(Setup, CreateContract, ExecuteTx, VerifyState)$ such that:

1. $Setup(1^\lambda) \rightarrow pp$: Generates public parameters $pp$.
2. $CreateContract(pp, code, initialState) \rightarrow (cid, proof)$: Creates a contract with identifier $cid$ and proof of correct initialization.
3. $ExecuteTx(pp, cid, tx, oldState, witness) \rightarrow (newState, proof)$: Executes a transaction $tx$ on the contract, producing a new state and proof of correct execution.
4. $VerifyState(pp, cid, stateRoot, proof) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$: Verifies that the state root is correct using the proof.

## 4. Implementation in Rust

/// A simplified representation of a zk-SNARK proving system
pub struct ZkSnark {
    proving_key: ProvingKey,
    verification_key: VerificationKey,
}

        // Implementation details omitted
        ZkSnark {

    }
}

    // Implementation-specific fields omitted
}

    fn setup<R: Relation>(relation: &R, security_param: u32) -> Self {
        // Implementation details omitted
        Groth16 { /* ... */ }
    }
    
    fn prove<T: Statement, W: Witness>(&self, statement: &T, witness: &W) -> Proof {
        // Implementation details omitted
        Proof { /* ... */ }
    }
    
    fn verify<T: Statement>(&self, statement: &T, proof: &Proof) -> bool {
        // Implementation details omitted
        true
    }
}
```

## 5. Applications in Web3

### 5.1 Privacy-Preserving DeFi

**Theorem 5.1.1** (Private Automated Market Maker) There exists a zero-knowledge proof system that allows an automated market maker to:

1. Prove that a trade satisfies the constant product formula $(x + \Delta x)(y - \Delta y) = xy$
2. Prove that reserves are non-negative
3. Prove that fees are correctly calculated and collected

Without revealing the actual values of reserves or the trade amounts.

*Proof:* We construct a circuit that takes as private inputs the values $x$, $y$, $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$, and computes the constant product constraint. The circuit also computes the fee amount and verifies that all values are non-negative. The zero-knowledge property ensures that these values remain hidden.

### 5.2 Scalable Verification of Computation

**Theorem 5.2.1** (Recursive Proof Composition) Given a zk-SNARK system $(G, P, V)$ with a verification algorithm that can be efficiently represented as a circuit, there exists a recursive SNARK system that can verify an arbitrary number of proof steps with a constant-size proof.

*Proof sketch:* We create a circuit that implements the verifier $V$. We then use this circuit to verify previous proofs, creating a chain of proofs that can be recursively verified. The final proof attests to the validity of the entire chain of computation.

## 6. Formal Security Analysis

### 6.1 Security Reductions

**Theorem 6.1.1** (Security of zk-SNARKs) The security of the Groth16 zk-SNARK system reduces to the $q$-Power Knowledge of Exponent assumption and the $d$-Power Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear groups.

*Proof sketch:* We show that if an adversary can produce valid proofs for false statements, then we can construct an algorithm that breaks the underlying cryptographic assumptions. Specifically, we use the adversary to extract knowledge that violates the Knowledge of Exponent assumption.

### 6.2 Composition Security

**Theorem 6.2.1** (Composition of Zero-Knowledge Proofs) Let $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$ be two zero-knowledge proof systems. Then their sequential composition $\Pi_1 \circ \Pi_2$ is also a zero-knowledge proof system.

*Proof:* We construct a simulator for the composed system by running the simulators for $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$ in sequence. The computational indistinguishability of the simulated transcripts follows from the computational indistinguishability of the individual simulators.
