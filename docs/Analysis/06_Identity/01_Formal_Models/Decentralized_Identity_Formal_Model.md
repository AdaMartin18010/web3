# Decentralized Identity Formal Model

## 1. Mathematical Foundations

### 1.1 Basic Definitions

**Definition 1.1.1** (Decentralized Identity) A decentralized identity system is a tuple $(I, C, V, P, R)$ where:

1. $I$ is a set of identity identifiers (DIDs).
2. $C$ is a set of cryptographic key pairs.
3. $V$ is a set of verifiable claims.
4. $P$ is a set of proofs.
5. $R$ is a set of resolution mechanisms.

**Definition 1.1.2** (Decentralized Identifier) A decentralized identifier (DID) is a unique string $d \in I$ with the format `did:method:specific-idstring`, where:

- `method` identifies the DID method
- `specific-idstring` is a method-specific identifier generated in a decentralized manner

**Definition 1.1.3** (Identity Graph) An identity graph is a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ where:

- $V$ is a set of vertices representing DIDs and claims
- $E$ is a set of directed edges representing attestations and relationships

### 1.2 Cryptographic Primitives

**Definition 1.2.1** (DID Document) A DID document for an identity $d \in I$ is a data structure $D_d$ that contains:

1. The DID subject $d$
2. A set of public keys $K_d \subset C$
3. A set of service endpoints $S_d$
4. A set of verification relationships $R_d$

**Property 1.2.2** (DID Resolution) A DID resolution function $R: I \rightarrow D \cup \{\perp\}$ maps a DID to its DID document or returns $\perp$ if the resolution fails.

**Property 1.2.3** (Authentication) An authentication function $Auth: I \times C \times P \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ verifies that a proof $p \in P$ demonstrates control of a DID $d \in I$ using key pair $(pk, sk) \in C$.

## 2. Verifiable Credentials Formal Model

### 2.1 Definitions

**Definition 2.1.1** (Verifiable Credential) A verifiable credential is a tuple $(id, s, iss, sub, c, p)$ where:

- $id$ is a unique identifier
- $s$ is the credential schema
- $iss$ is the issuer's DID
- $sub$ is the subject's DID
- $c$ is a set of claims about the subject
- $p$ is a cryptographic proof binding the components

**Definition 2.1.2** (Credential Schema) A credential schema $S$ is a formal description of the structure and constraints of a credential's claims, typically represented as a JSON Schema or similar format.

**Definition 2.1.3** (Verifiable Presentation) A verifiable presentation is a data structure that contains a subset of verifiable credentials from one or more issuers, packaged with proofs that demonstrate the presenter's control of the included credentials.

### 2.2 Trust Framework

**Theorem 2.2.1** (Credential Verification) A verifiable credential $(id, s, iss, sub, c, p)$ is valid if and only if:

1. The credential conforms to schema $s$
2. The issuer $iss$ is trusted for credentials of schema $s$
3. The proof $p$ verifies using the issuer's verification key
4. The credential has not been revoked

*Proof sketch:* Credential verification involves checking the cryptographic signature using the issuer's public key retrieved from their DID document, validating the schema conformance, checking revocation status, and verifying the trust chain to the issuer.

**Definition 2.2.2** (Trust Registry) A trust registry is a function $T: I \times S \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that determines whether an identity $i \in I$ is trusted to issue credentials of schema $s \in S$.

## 3. Privacy and Security Properties

### 3.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Identity

**Definition 3.1.1** (Zero-Knowledge Identity Proof) A zero-knowledge identity proof is a tuple $(c, π, v)$ where:

- $c$ is a claim or credential
- $π$ is a zero-knowledge proof
- $v$ is a verification function such that $v(c, π) = 1$ if the proof is valid

**Theorem 3.1.2** (Selective Disclosure) Given a verifiable credential $(id, s, iss, sub, c, p)$ with claims $c = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}$, there exists a selective disclosure proof system that allows the subject to create a proof $p'$ that reveals only a subset of claims $\{c_{i_1}, c_{i_2}, ..., c_{i_k}\}$ while still proving the validity of the original credential.

*Proof sketch:* Using Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs, the subject can prove knowledge of all claims and reveal only selected ones while maintaining the cryptographic binding to the issuer's signature.

### 3.2 Formal Security Analysis

**Theorem 3.2.1** (Identity Security) In a properly implemented decentralized identity system, an adversary without access to private keys cannot:

1. Impersonate an identity
2. Forge valid credentials
3. Create unauthorized presentations

*Proof sketch:* The security relies on the unforgeability of digital signatures and the security of the underlying public key cryptography. If an adversary could violate any of these properties, they could break the underlying cryptographic primitives.

**Definition 3.2.2** (Forward Secrecy) A decentralized identity system has forward secrecy if compromise of current key material does not enable decryption of past communications or forgery of past credentials.

## 4. Implementation in Rust

```rust
/// A simplified DID implementation
pub struct DecentralizedIdentifier {
    method: String,
    id_string: String,
}

impl DecentralizedIdentifier {
    pub fn new(method: &str, id_string: &str) -> Self {
        DecentralizedIdentifier {
            method: method.to_string(),
            id_string: id_string.to_string(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        format!("did:{}:{}", self.method, self.id_string)
    }
    
    pub fn from_string(did_string: &str) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let parts: Vec<&str> = did_string.split(':').collect();
        if parts.len() < 3 || parts[0] != "did" {
            return Err("Invalid DID format");
        }
        Ok(DecentralizedIdentifier {
            method: parts[1].to_string(),
            id_string: parts[2..].join(":"),
        })
    }
}

/// Verifiable credential implementation
pub struct VerifiableCredential {
    id: String,
    schema_id: String,
    issuer_did: DecentralizedIdentifier,
    subject_did: DecentralizedIdentifier,
    claims: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
    proof: Proof,
}

impl VerifiableCredential {
    pub fn new(
        id: &str,
        schema_id: &str,
        issuer_did: DecentralizedIdentifier,
        subject_did: DecentralizedIdentifier,
        claims: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
    ) -> Self {
        // In a real implementation, proof would be generated here
        let proof = Proof::new();
        
        VerifiableCredential {
            id: id.to_string(),
            schema_id: schema_id.to_string(),
            issuer_did,
            subject_did,
            claims,
            proof,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn verify(&self, trust_registry: &TrustRegistry) -> bool {
        // Check if issuer is trusted for this credential type
        if !trust_registry.is_trusted(&self.issuer_did, &self.schema_id) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Verify the proof
        self.proof.verify()
    }
    
    pub fn create_presentation(&self, 
                              disclosed_claims: &[String], 
                              holder_key: &PrivateKey) -> VerifiablePresentation {
        // Create a selective disclosure presentation
        // Implementation details omitted
        VerifiablePresentation::new(self, disclosed_claims, holder_key)
    }
}

/// Trust registry implementation
pub struct TrustRegistry {
    trusted_issuers: HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>, // schema_id -> set of trusted issuer DIDs
}

impl TrustRegistry {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        TrustRegistry {
            trusted_issuers: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn add_trusted_issuer(&mut self, schema_id: &str, issuer_did: &DecentralizedIdentifier) {
        let issuers = self.trusted_issuers
            .entry(schema_id.to_string())
            .or_insert_with(HashSet::new);
        issuers.insert(issuer_did.to_string());
    }
    
    pub fn is_trusted(&self, issuer_did: &DecentralizedIdentifier, schema_id: &str) -> bool {
        self.trusted_issuers
            .get(schema_id)
            .map_or(false, |issuers| issuers.contains(&issuer_did.to_string()))
    }
}
```

## 5. Decentralized Identity in Web3

### 5.1 Smart Contract Integration

**Definition 5.1.1** (On-chain Identity Registry) An on-chain identity registry is a smart contract that maps DIDs to on-chain accounts and stores verification methods and service endpoints.

```solidity
// Simplified example of an on-chain DID Registry
contract DIDRegistry {
    struct DIDDocument {
        address controller;
        mapping(string => string) verificationMethods;
        mapping(string => string) services;
        uint256 updated;
    }
    
    mapping(string => DIDDocument) public dids;
    
    event DIDUpdated(string did, address controller, uint256 timestamp);
    
    function createDID(string memory did) public {
        require(dids[did].controller == address(0), "DID already exists");
        dids[did].controller = msg.sender;
        dids[did].updated = block.timestamp;
        emit DIDUpdated(did, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function updateVerificationMethod(string memory did, string memory id, string memory method) public {
        require(dids[did].controller == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
        dids[did].verificationMethods[id] = method;
        dids[did].updated = block.timestamp;
        emit DIDUpdated(did, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function addService(string memory did, string memory id, string memory endpoint) public {
        require(dids[did].controller == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
        dids[did].services[id] = endpoint;
        dids[did].updated = block.timestamp;
        emit DIDUpdated(did, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Decentralized Identity and Access Management

**Definition 5.2.1** (DIAM) A Decentralized Identity and Access Management system is a tuple $(I, P, R, A)$ where:

- $I$ is a set of decentralized identities
- $P$ is a set of permissioned resources
- $R$ is a set of access rules
- $A$ is an access control function $A: I \times P \times R \rightarrow \{0,1\}$

**Theorem 5.2.2** (DIAM Composability) Access decisions can be composed from multiple credential verifications, allowing complex policies based on the combination of multiple verifiable credentials.

*Proof sketch:* By representing access policies as boolean functions over credential verification results, complex combinations of credentials can be evaluated to yield a single access decision.

## 6. Advanced Identity Topics

### 6.1 Soulbound Tokens as Identity Credentials

**Definition 6.1.1** (Soulbound Token) A Soulbound Token (SBT) is a non-transferable token $(id, a, m, i)$ where:

- $id$ is a unique token identifier
- $a$ is the address to which the token is bound
- $m$ is the token metadata
- $i$ is the issuer address

**Theorem 6.1.2** (SBT as Credential) Soulbound tokens can function as verifiable credentials with the constraint that they cannot be transferred between identities.

*Proof sketch:* SBTs implement the core properties of verifiable credentials—issuance, verification, and revocation—while adding the non-transferability constraint through smart contract enforcement.

### 6.2 Decentralized Reputation Systems

**Definition 6.2.1** (Reputation System) A decentralized reputation system is a tuple $(I, A, S, C)$ where:

- $I$ is a set of identities
- $A$ is a set of actions
- $S: I \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a scoring function
- $C$ is a set of context-specific parameters

**Theorem 6.2.2** (Reputation Non-transferability) In a secure decentralized identity system, reputation cannot be transferred between distinct identities without leaving cryptographic evidence of the transfer.

*Proof sketch:* Since reputation is bound to specific DIDs and their cryptographic keys, transferring reputation would require transferring control of those keys, which leaves an audit trail in the key management history.

### 6.3 Self-Sovereign Identity Principles

**Definition 6.3.1** (Self-Sovereign Identity) A self-sovereign identity system satisfies the following formal properties:

1. **Existence**: Identities must exist independently of specific authorities
2. **Control**: Users must control their identities without intermediaries
3. **Access**: Users must have access to their own data
4. **Persistence**: Identities should be long-lived
5. **Portability**: Information and services about identity must be transportable

**Theorem 6.3.2** (SSI Completeness) A decentralized identity system $(I, C, V, P, R)$ is self-sovereign if and only if:

1. For all $i \in I$, the key material in $C$ for $i$ is exclusively controlled by the identity owner
2. Resolution $R$ can be performed without dependency on a single controlling entity
3. Credentials in $V$ can be selectively disclosed using proofs in $P$

*Proof sketch:* These conditions ensure the core SSI properties—control by the identity subject, independence from controlling authorities, and selective privacy-preserving disclosure.

## 7. Future Research Directions

The formal modeling of decentralized identity in Web3 provides a rigorous foundation for developing identity systems. Future research should focus on:

1. Quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes for long-term identity security
2. Formal models for social recovery of lost identity keys
3. Interoperability protocols between different DID methods
4. Privacy-preserving methods for credential aggregation and presentation
5. Formal verification of smart contract-based identity registries
